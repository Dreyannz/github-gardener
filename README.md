			You are using GitHub Gardener's Free Tier

			I just built something way way cooler, it's called Stealth Mode!

			It's just like this version, but with a private repository. Your GitHub turns green, your commits cannot be seen!

			It costs 5$/mo. This is the first time I am asking for money for one of my projects, and although it feels weird, I know it is a necessary step towards achieving my dream of becoming an indie maker

			Please, make sure to find me and even DM me on Twitter @alexsideris_ or in the chatbox at githubgardener.xyz 

			You can upgrade to Stealth here: www.githubgardener.xyz

			Much love, Alex
