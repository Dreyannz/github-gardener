			Hey everyone!

			The bot can now push automated pull requests, code reviews and issues!

			Plus, GitHub announced that private repositories are now available for everyone!

			That means you can now have a green contribution history and a diamond contribution chart, and no one can see the commits since they are made in a private repository.

			So the features we have are:

			--> Stealth ($5/mo): Automated commits to a private repository

			--> Ninja ($10/mo): Automated commits, pull requests, code reviews and issues to a private repository

			Basically the tiers are at the price of one and two cups of coffee per month respectively. I think that's fair :)

			Thank you once again for using GitHub Gardener, honestly. I am still trying to achieve my dream of living by doing what I love, and I am getting closer and closer every day!!!

			Please, make sure to find me and even DM me on Twitter @alexsideris_ or in the chatbox at githubgardener.co 

			You can upgrade to Stealth or Ninja here: www.githubgardener.co

			Much love, Alex
